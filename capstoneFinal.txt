Drilling simple git/hub sequence as Capstone:

- clone github repo (git clone)
- create and switch to a new branch called 'feature' (git switch -c)
- modify files and stage changes (git add .)
- confirm file staging (git status)
- simulate mistake and resolve (restore --staged)
- re-stage and commit changes (git commit)
- view commit history (git log --oneline)
- undo bad [un-pushed] commit (reset --soft HEAD~1)
- re-commit and push changes to project (git push -u origin)
- [On GitHub] pull request, merge branches, modify file
- switch to main and pull latest changes (git pull)
- clean workspace (git branch -d)
